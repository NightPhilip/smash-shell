Smash - Simple Shell
Overview
Smash (Simple Shell) is a lightweight, Unix shell-like command interpreter that allows users to execute commands in a Unix/Linux environment. It is designed to parse command line inputs into arguments and execute them, similar to standard shells like bash or zsh.

Features
Command Parsing: Splits a command line input into arguments for execution.
Execution: Runs commands as entered by the user in a manner similar to traditional Unix shells.
(Additional features would be listed here based on the full content of the smash.c file.)
Requirements
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any standard C compiler
Unix/Linux environment
Compilation
To compile Smash, navigate to the directory containing smash.c and run the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
gcc -o smash smash.c
This command will compile the smash.c source file and create an executable named smash.

Usage
To run Smash, use the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
./smash
Once running, you can enter commands just like you would in any standard shell.
